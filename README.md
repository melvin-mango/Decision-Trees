# Decision Tree Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Decision Tree assignment. The primary goal of this assignment is to build, visualize, and evaluate a decision tree classifier using the provided datasets.

## Contents

- `Decision_tree_assignment.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `animals.csv`: Dataset containing information about different animals.
- `vertebrate.csv`: Dataset containing information about vertebrates.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/melvin-mango/Decision-Trees.git
   cd decision-tree-assignment
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Google Colab Notebook

The `Decision_Trees_assignment.ipynb` file contains the Google Colab notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation. To run this notebook:

1. Upload the notebook file to your Google Drive.
2. Open Google Colab in your browser: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Open the uploaded notebook from your Google Drive in Google Colab.
4. Ensure that the `animals.csv` and `vertebrate.csv` datasets are available in the appropriate path (typically by uploading the datasets to your Google Drive or using the Colab file system).

## Datasets

The datasets used for this assignment are included in the `animals.csv` and `vertebrate.csv` files. Make sure these dataset files are present before running the code. If you are using your own datasets, replace these files with your dataset files and update the file paths in the code accordingly.

## Results

Results of the model training and evaluation, including visualizations and performance metrics, will be displayed in the notebook.
